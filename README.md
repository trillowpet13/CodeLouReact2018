Welcome to The Search Bar!

Grab some friends and try out the newest way to find breweries in your area!
All you have to do is start typing in the search bar and local breweries with their city, state, and type of brew magically appear!
Don't have any friends? Thats perfectly okay! You can go with me! 

Here's how it try it:
-download the git clone (copy and paste url)
-install on console with: npm install
-again in console: npm start

*****Disclaimer*****
Unfortunately, I could not finish my development in the allotted time given. I understand excuses are uneccessary because I should have been committing throughout the process, but there's not much I can do when my hard drive fails... :(

All I have to say is that I tried my absolute hardest given my circumstances and I enjoyed my time doing it. (Even though I pulled three all-nighters with a few naps sprinkled between)

Thank you so much for checking out my masterpiece! I am looking forward to redeeming myself next session! :D
